JavaScript :-

What is a Web Scripting? 

		Programming with Web Page.

There are different types of Script Languages
		ECMAScript 
		VBScript = it supports only IE Browser
		JavaScript = It is a browser independent script lang. 
		jQuery  =  Modified and Simplified Version of JavaScript.

		Front End Languages for UI Design of web pages:- 
		Angular JS / Angular (TypeScript)
		React JS  (ES6)
		Node JS
What is a JavaScript?
		
		It is a loosely	typed script language which menat for following two things
				1.  Creating Dynamic Web Pages.
				2.  Validating Html form Inputs.

1.  Any Script Language is not having data types to declare variables. 
	so that to declare variable use following syntax
				variablename = value;
				var/let  variablename = value;
2.  Any script has to be integrate with HTML Program only. To write any script use following tag
		<script type="text/javascript">
				code.....
		</script> 
	This tag has to be palced either in <head> / end of <body> tag.

3.  To print something on browser
		document.write(stmt/variable);		
			document is a object which specified currently working web page.
4.  To print something on Browser Console
		console.log(stmt/varaible)
5.  JavaScript is a Function Based Script Lang, so that every task has to be done by creating a user defined function and it has to be called based on requirement. 

Function  <function_name>([arg])
{
	body of the fun
	[return <value>]
}

to call the function 
	function_name([arg values]);
6. While creating html forms, every input tool has to be enclosed within the <form> tag.
<form name="..."   method="GET/POST"  action="pagename/servlet/controllername/...">
....
</form>

Note :-  to get or set value from any tool, 
		formname.toolname.value;

getElementById("name") :-  this method allows to identify any element(tag) with "Id" property. 
it has two properties :-

innerText  :-  it allows to assign value only in text format.
innerHTML  :-  it allows to assign value with html styling. 

there are two conversion functions :- 

parseInt() :-  it converts string value into Integer value.
parseFloat() :-  it converts string value into Float value.

-------------------------
for RadioButtons and DropdownList uses an event "onchange" for the functionality. 

-----------------------------
onload Event :-  this event performs action whenever a page is loading. so that it has to be used with body tag as follows 

<body onload="fun_name()">
-------------------------------
to declare an array :- var arrname = [val1, val2, val3, ...]
----------------------------
As per the script, there is a button called "submit", which meant for submitting page to the server.
