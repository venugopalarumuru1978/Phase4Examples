Today's Agenda
---------------
1. JSON REST API SERVER
2. RxJS Module
---------------
JSON Server:- 

By Using This Server we can create REST API's in JSON Format. 

Steps :- 

1. Install JSON Server by using command prompt
	npm install -g json-server
2. Now Create a file with the name of "db.json", then add table structure in the form of json as follows

{
"tablename" :[
	{
		"fieldname":value,
		"fieldname":value,
		......
	}, 
	{
		"fieldname":value,
		"fieldname":value,
		......
	}, 
.......
],

"tablename" :[
	{
		"fieldname":value,
		"fieldname":value,
		......
	}, 
	{
		"fieldname":value,
		"fieldname":value,
		......
	}, 
.......
],

"tablename" :[
	{
		"fieldname":value,
		"fieldname":value,
		......
	}, 
	{
		"fieldname":value,
		"fieldname":value,
		......
	}, 
.......
], 

.......
}

3. to work with JSON Server, we have to start that server with following command
	json-server db.json

here  JSON Server runs on following url: http://localhost:3000/
4. Now Open Browser then use following URL to check server. 

Note:-  Ctrl + C to stop server

RxJS Module
---------------------
RxJS stands for *R*eactive E*x*tensions for *J*ava*S*cript, 

and itâ€™s a library that gives us an implementation of Observables for JavaScript.
RxJS, is a reactive library used to implement reactive programming to deal with async implementation, callbacks, and event-based programs.

Observable :- It is a data source(events, http request, custom data source..) which sends in then form of data packets to the observer.

Observer :-  It is an object that subscribes to the observable and listens to the data packets that sends by observable.

these two classes comes under RxJS Module.  
--------------------
What is a Subscription?  
Normally Subscription means an arrangement to receive something.   

Similarly, in Angular applications Observables will be connected to observers and whenever they observe a new value or change in data, they will execute code with the help of Subscription and all the subscribed components will receive the updated outcome. 

There is a method to this action subscribe(). 

--------------------------------------------------
HttpClient :-  This class is used to send request and get responses with the help of any API's.

getmapping  = get()
postmapping = post()
putmapping = put()
deletemapping = delete()
