	Introduction
	Components
	DataBindings

What is an Angular?
	It is a Client-side framework used to create web applications. 
	It is a meant  for to create SPA(Single Page Appliaction) based web application.
	Angular works baed on TypeScript
	It is a Cross-Browser/Platform compitable fw. 
	It separates Script Logic  and UI Logic by using DOM Manipulations.

How to Install Angular:- 
----------------------
1.  Install Node JS
2.  Install TypeScript
3.  Install Angular CLI as follows from the command prompt.
		npm install @angular/cli -g
			the above command installs latest version of Angular.
		npm install @angular/cli@10.2.0 -g
			this command installs specific version of Angular. 

4.  Install any one editor to work with angular application(VS Code).
--------------------------------------------------
How to create an angular application.

1.  Open Command Prompt then use following command
	ng new <application_name>
2.  Open application by using VSCode
3.  To run the application, command prompt
	ng serve

Angular application comes with a web server, it has default port no : 4200
	once app executed, open browser then use following url
		http://localhost:4200/
---------------------------------------------------
What is a Component?
	It is a building block of the Angular App where it is meant for creating and desing web pages.
	Every Component will have following four items

		html page for designing
		css file for to write css
		ts(typescript) for script functionality
		spec.ts Page for testing purpose.

	Every Angular App having a default component called as "App" component. 
	Which is also called as "Root" Component. 

whenever we run the application, first Index.html page will be loaded, within that page "App" component will be rendered. 

to create a component :-     
			ng  generate  component  <componentname>/ ng  g  component  <componentname>
-----------------------------------------
Data Bindings :- 

It is a  relation b/w script and html page(template). 

these are implemented in 4 ways

1. Interpolation
2. Property Binding
3. Event Binding
4. Two - Way Binding

Interpolation :-  it is the process of showing typescript variable value into html page. 
			{{variable name}}

Property Binding :- it is also used to bind variable value to any tool like textbox, radiobutton, ...
		<tag  [attribute_name]="variablename" ... />

Event Binding :- it is used to to call a typescript method for an event like click, doubleclick, ....

	<input type="button"  (event_name)="methodname()" />

	<input type="button"  onclick="demo()" />  == html format
	
	<input type="button"   (click)="demo()" />  == angular format
---------------------------
Two - Way Binding :- It is the process of change the value of variable at run-time and vice-versa.
			i.e. if we change value in script it has to change in template and vice versa.
		<tag  [(ngModel)]="variablename" />

	"ngModel" is one of the pre-defined directive which is used to create two way binding.

Note :-  import "FormsModule"  in app.modules.ts file
	import { FormsModule } from '@angular/forms';
then add "FormsModule" in Imports section as follows
 imports: [
    BrowserModule,
    AppRoutingModule,
    FormsModule
  ],
