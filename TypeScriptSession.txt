Today's Agenda :- 
-----------------
1. TypeScript
2. Introduction to Angular
--------------------------
What is a TypeScript?

It is a programming language which is developed by using JavaScript. 
It is a superset of JavaScript, Addition to JavaScript following concepts are added

1. DataTypes
2. Oops Concepts
3. Misc Features
	a. Arrow Functions
	b. Multiline Strings
	c. String Interpolation
	d. Modules

Points of Typescript:- 

1. TypeScript doesn't support directly in web page, so that typescript has to be convert into javascript, then we can use that script code.

2.  All typescript codes having an extension filename.ts, once it is complied and converted then it generates filename.js file. 

		Filename.ts  ===>  TypeScript Compiler  ===> Filename.js


Advantages of Typescript :-
---------------------------
1.  Static Typing and Type Safety
	Static Typing :-   whenever we can fix a data type for the variable while declaration pf variable and we can't change it's data type thoughout the program, then it is called as Static Type.
	Ex:-  C, C++, Java, ....

	Dynamic Typing :- whenever we can't fix the data type for a variable, based on variable value the data type will be fixed. so that whenever it required, we can change the data type of variable by changing the value. 

	TypeScript supports both typings. 

2. Error Handling :-  Since typescript having compiler, there are chance of identifing errors in the program.

3. OOPS concepts
4. Intellisence


Data Types:- 
------------
As per typescript, following data types are existed

1. number :-  it is meant for both integers and float values.
2. string :- it is meant for string values.
3. boolean :- it is for true/false.
4. any :-  for any data type value.

How to Declare Variable :

	var <variable name> : datatype = <value>;

what is a npm?

it is a node package manager installer. 

there are different frontend programming lang,
		Angular
		React Js
		Node Js
		Express Js
		Vue Js
It is the world's largest software library which provides library files for above speicifed lang. 
It is also called as Software Package Manager and Installer. 
It contains over  8lakhs code packages. 
it is a open source, i.e. any body can download and use it freely. 
this npm includes CLI(Command Line Client) that can be used to download and install softwares. 

Download and Install NPM:-

NPM is installed with Node JS, so that we have to download and install Node JS, so that it automatically installs "NPM".

we can download "Node JS" from web site "https://nodejs.org"

download and install node version 10.13.0

now we can install typescript with following command
			a.  First goto command prompt
			b.  use following command to install it
					"npm install typescript -g"

Steps to write typescript program:- 
----------------------------------
1.  Open any text editor(VSCode)
2.  Code the program and save with .ts extension
3.  Compile the program 
	tsc  <filename.ts>
4. Once it is compiled successfully, it generates .js file, now it can be executed as follows
	node "filename.js"
---------------------------------
OOPS Concepts in TypeScript

Class Creation:- 

class <classname>
{
	variable:data type=value;
	..........
	..........

	methodname([arg]) : returntype
	{
		body of the method
	}
}

Object Creation :- 
		var <objectname> = new <classname>([arg]);

here also we are having access specifier, 
				private, public, protected
Note :- to access variable within the class for set / get value :  "this.variable"
-----------------------------
How to create a constructor :- 

class <classname>
{
	constructor([parameters])
	{
		.......
	}
}

It will execute whenever an object is created for the class. 
-----------------------
Inheritance :- 

In inheritance,  to inherit parent class to the child class "extends" keyword is used. 

Data Abstraction can be achieved with the help of "Interface".

To inherit an interface to the class, we have to use "implements" keyword.
----------------
Enumerations :- 
It is a collection of constants grouping under one unit. 

it acts as one of the user defined data type. 

enum  <enum_name>
{
	Const-1, Const-2, ......
}

-------------------------------
Module :- 

A module is a class(s) where it allows to export from one program to another program. 

Purpose  of this concept is, export one class into another class within the application. 

while creating class, we have to use "export" keyword for the class. 

export class <classname>
{
	
}


where ever  using this exported class, there we have to import the class as follows. 

import {classname, ..} from "./filename";
