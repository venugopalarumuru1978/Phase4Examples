CSS :- Cascade Style Sheets

It is meant for appling some styles for the web page elements. 
Styles like :  colors, fonts, margins, ......

Css will be applied on web page in 3 ways :-

1. Inline CSS		:-  these css are implemented for every tag with style property.
				<tag  style="propname:value;propname:value;.....>

2. Page Level CSS	:-   these type of css will be created in head tag by using <style> tag. 

		<head>
			<style>
				...
			</style>
		</head>

		Here css will be applied for every tag as follows

			tagname{
				propname:value;
				propname:value;
				......
			}

		css allows to write user defined css classes
		these classes are defined by starting with either ./# then  classname

			.cssclassname{
				propname:value;
			}
				to implement :
					<tagname class="css classname" ... />			
			#cssclassname{
				propname:value;
			}
				to implement 
					<tagname id="css classname" ..... />
3. Site Level CSS :- these css are used in multiple web pages. 

		a.  Create a css file having extension .css
		b.  Define all css classes in that file
		c.  Link this css file to the every web page whereever it is needed in <head> tag.
				<link herf="css file name"  rel="stylesheet" />
